Project Overview:
This project is an AI-powered image captioning system that generates text descriptions for images. It combines computer vision (for image analysis) and NLP (for text generation).

Technologies Used:

Python: For scripting the AI model.
TensorFlow/Keras: For training and using deep learning models.
Pre-trained ResNet/VGG: For extracting image features.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): For generating captions.
Features:

Image Feature Extraction: Uses ResNet/VGG to analyze image contents.
Caption Generation: Uses an LSTM model to form meaningful descriptions.
Deep Learning Integration: Learns from datasets of image-caption pairs.
File Descriptions:

image_captioning.py: Contains the AI model, image feature extraction, and caption generation logic.
How to Run the Project:

Install required dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV).
Run the script (python image_captioning.py).
Provide an image, and the AI will generate a caption.
